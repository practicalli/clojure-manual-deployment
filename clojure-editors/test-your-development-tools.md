# Test your development tools

We have created an example Clojure project called "Welcome To ClojureBridge" to test your development tools.

[Download the "Welcome To ClojureBridge" zip file](https://github.com/ClojureBridgeLondon/welcometoclojurebridge/archive/master.zip) and extract all the files.

Run a REPL in the project using your Clojure editor or on the command line

```bash
cd welcometoclojurebridge
lein repl
```


## Alternatively: Use Git to download example project

If you are comfortable using the git version control tool and the command line, then you can use the following to run the REPL

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ClojureBridge/welcometoclojurebridge
cd welcometoclojurebridge
lein repl
```
