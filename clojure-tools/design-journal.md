# Design Journal
A design journal captures with code and comments the decisions taken for a project, invaluable to anyone trying to get up to speed with a project.


## Using a design-journal namespace
A single namespace encourages the journal to flow as the design of the application flows.  So onboarding onto a project is essentially reading and evaluating code from top to bottom.


## Using comment blocks
It is useful to include examples of how you expect key parts of the system to be called and the kind of arguments they receive.  Placing these examples in a (comment ,,,) expression ensures they are not accidentally evaluated whilst showing the most important function calls in a particular namespace.
