# Development Environments

![Leiningen and LightTable logo](/images/clojure-practicalli-banner.png)

  This workshop encourages [LightTable](http://lighttable.com/) & [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org/) as the development environment, as they are the easiest tools to set up.
  
  Leiningen is the build automation tool used to manage Clojure projects.  It will create projects from templates and run our Clojure environment (REPL).

  LightTable is a Clojure aware editor that supports the dynamic workflow of Clojure development in a REPL.  LightTable is also written in Clojure (and ClojureScript).
  
  The following pages will show you how to set up LightTable and Leiningen.
