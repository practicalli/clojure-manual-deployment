# Creating a project 

  Its easy to create a new Clojure project with Leiningen, simply run the command `lein new template-name project-name`.  The template-name can be app ... or one of the templates on Clojars (more on this later).
  
> **Note** Create a new project called practicalli

  Open a terminal window and in a directory where you usually keep your projects, run the following command 
  
    lein new app practicalli

  A new directory will be created called `practicalli` and the contents of the directory should be as follows:

> **fixme** add screenshot of project structure inside the practicalli directory, including the source tree to show the namespace.

---

> **Comment** The project-name will also be the namespace used for the project.
