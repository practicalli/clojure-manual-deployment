# Load Testing

The [Gatling](https://github.com/mhjort/clj-gatling) project can be used to create and run load tests using Clojure (and get fancy reports).

Add the following to your project.clj :dependencies

```
[clj-gatling "0.11.0"]
```


## Describe a Load Test

This is how we would write a simple load test which performs 50 GET requests against a server running at test.com:

```
class SimpleSimulation extends Simulation {
  //declare a scenario with a simple get request performed 5 times
  val scn = scenario("myScenario")
            .exec(http("myRequest").get("http://test.com/page.html"))
            .repeat(5)

  //run the scenario with 10 concurrent users
  setUp(scn.users(10))
}
```

Gatling refers to load tests as Simulations which have one or more Scenarios. In the one above we are saying we will have 10 users execute 5 requests each in parallel. We could provide a Content-Type header with the request and check for a 200 response code like this:


```
http("myRequest")
  .get("http://test.com/page.html")
  .header("Content-Type", "text/html")
  .check(status.is(200))
If we wanted to do a POST request with a JSON body and basic authentication, as well as verify something in the response:

http("myRequest")
  .post("http://test.com/someresource"))
  .body(StringBody("""{ "myContent": "myValue" }"""))
  .asJSON
  .basicAuth("username", "password")
  .check(jsonPath("$..someField").is("some value"))
```

The expression used to extract someField from the response is passed to jsonPath() and is based on Goessnerâ€™s JsonPath syntax. We use is() to verify the expected value is equal to some value. We can also do other forms of verification on the response json like:

* not(expectedValue): not equal to expectedValue
* in(sequence): to check that a value belongs to the given sequence
* exists(), notExists(): to check for the presence/absence of a field

For a multipart request with 2 parts and gzip compression:

```
http("myRequest")
  .post("http://test.com/someresource"))
  .bodyPart(StringBodyPart("""{ "myContent": "myValue" }"""))
  .bodyPart(RawFileBodyPart("file", "test.txt")
  .processRequestBody(gzipBody)
We can also create scenarios with multiple requests and use the result from previous requests in subsequent requests like this:

scenario("myScenario")
  .exec(http("request1")
          .post("http://test.com/resource1")
          .body(StringBody"""{ "myContent": ""}""")
          .check(jsonPath("$..myResponse.guid").saveAs("guid")))
  .exec(http("request2")
          .put("http://test.com/resource2/${guid}")
          .body(StringBody"""{ "someOtherField": ""}"""))
```

guid is extracted from the response of the first call using saveAs("guid") and used in the path to the PUT call.

Scenarios can also be run with a ramp up. If we wanted to run the scenario above with 1000 users with a ramp up of 20 seconds we would do:

```
setUp(scn.users(1000).ramp(20))
```


## Run a Simulation

There are a number of ways to run Gatling simulations. You can download the bundle, place your simulations under the user-files/simulations directory and then run bin/gatling.sh.

If you prefer integration with your build system there are plugins for Maven, Gradle and SBT. For example, for Maven we just add the dependencies in the pom.xml:


```
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>io.gatling.highcharts</groupId>
    <artifactId>gatling-charts-highcharts</artifactId>
    <scope>test</scope>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>

<build>
   <plugins>
     <plugin>
       <groupId>io.gatling</groupId>
       <artifactId>gatling-maven-plugin</artifactId>
     </plugin>
   </plugins>
</build>
```

Place simulations under src/test/scala/com/company/service and then in the terminal:


```
mvn gatling:execute -Dgatling.simulationClass=com.company.service.YourSimulation
```
