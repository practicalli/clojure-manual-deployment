## Create a new Clojure project
Use [Clojure CLI tools and clj-new](/clojure-tools/install/install-clojure.html#clojure-cli-tools-common-aliases) to create a new Clojure project.

```shell
clojure -A:new app practicalli/salary-calculator
```

## Complete project also in Git

  If you prefer not to type in all the code, there is a complete project available at the [Devoxx-Clojure-Code Github repository](https://github.com/jr0cket/devoxx-clojure-code.git).

  Clone the repository with the command `git clone https://github.com/jr0cket/devoxx-clojure-code.git`

  Each section is committed to a seperate branch so you can see the project incrementally unfold.  Branches can be listed with the command `git branch` and you switch to a branch using the command `git checkout name-of-branch`.

  If you wish to merge a branch into master, checkout the master branch and use the command `git merge name-of-branch`
