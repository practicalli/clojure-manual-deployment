# Code Examples for the Workshop

The code for this workshop is contained in the Github repository [Clojure Through Code](https://github.com/practicalli/clojure-through-code).

To get a copy of the repository, use the following git clone command which creates a new directory called clojure-through-code.

`git clone https://github.com/practicalli/clojure-example.git`

Each major section of the workbook has example code in a different file (and as you will discover, a different namespace)

To try out the example Clojure code, open the project in your favorite Clojure aware editor and start evaluating the code expression by expression.

> **Hint** Please note that the current sections of the workbook and sample code are being updated, so there may be some mis-match until this is complete- @jr0cket: Sun  1 May 13:33:41 BST 2016


Enjoy.
