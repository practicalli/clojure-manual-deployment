# How to use the workshop

If you are new to Clojure, it is recommended that you follow the workshop in order.

Most sections of the workshop are independent of each other so if you already know a particular topic you can either skip it or very quickly look at the examples.  Where there are dependencies on previous chapters, the section will indicate this at the start of the section.
