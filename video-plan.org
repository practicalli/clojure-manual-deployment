* Install Clojure cli tools
- cli tools install options, especially for windows
- where things are installed ?
- the .clojure directory
- adding aliases
- install practicalli/clojure.deps
- alternative: using borkdude tool

* Using the CLI
** Clojure evaluation
evaluate expressions quickly

clojure -e ,,,

clojure -e (+ 1 2 3 4)

Put expressions into a make file

clojure -e (+ 4 (* 4 7))

clojure -e (map inc [1 2 3 4 5])

clojure -e (partition
             2
             (clojure.string/split
               "Mary had a little lamb whose fleece was white as snow"
               #" "))

** Run the repl

** overview of most common options
Keep this simple as most will be done in rebel readline.
show difference between clojure and clj (which needs rlwrap installed)

* Run repl with rebl.readline
** Using rebel features
- eldoc style function signatures
- doc and source support
- loading files
